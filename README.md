# keylogger
This Python project creates a basic keylogger using the pynput library. It captures keystrokes pressed by the user and logs them into a text file. The program listens for keyboard events, recording both regular and special keys. The logging stops when the Esc key is pressed. This tool is intended for educational and authorized use only.
